abstract="Within this chapter, we are presenting how game developers could take inspiration from the research in Embodied Conversational Agent to develop non-player characters capable of expressing believable emotional and social reactions. Inspired by the social theories about human emotional and social reactions, the researchers working with Embodied Conversational Agents developed different computational models to reproduce these human mechanisms within virtual characters. We are listing some of these works, comparing the different approaches and theories considered.",
