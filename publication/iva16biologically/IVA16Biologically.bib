abstract="In this paper, we present a reflexive behavior architecture, that is geared towards the application in the control of the non-verbal behavior of the virtual humans in a public speaking training system. The model is organized along the distinction between behavior triggers that are internal (endogenous) to the agent, and those that origin in the environment (exogenous). The endogenous subsystem controls gaze behavior, triggers self-adaptors, and shifts between different postures, while the exogenous system controls the reaction towards auditory stimuli with different temporal and valence characteristics. We evaluate the different components empirically by letting participants compare the output of the proposed system to valid alternative variations.",
